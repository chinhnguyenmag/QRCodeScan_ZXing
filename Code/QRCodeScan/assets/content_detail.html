	We are Captix from 44Doors. In the last five years, we have generated 500 million QR codes, and collected stats for 1,000,000,000 scans from around the world. 
	<br /><br />
	We know our QR codes, and we have created our own app, Captix Scan.
	<br /><br />
	We have seen and used readers we recommend for most mobile devices. But, we never found an app we loved. They were always crashing unexpectedly, taking forever to load content, calling us mean names, or sticking their tongue out at us. We wanted better treatment for ourselves, and the majority of smartphone users in the world. 
	<br /><br />
	So, we built one ourselves. And, Captix Scan was Texas born and raised right.
